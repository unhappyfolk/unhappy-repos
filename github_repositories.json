Currently, the only way to mitigate this is to turn off backup of the app’s data entirely, in iCloud Backup’s Details screen, as pictured below.\r\n\r\nSince this data is reproducible (i.e. by tapping the “download” button), this does not need to be part of a device’s backup. While we can simply apply the workaround described earlier, which is to turn off backup of the app’s data, ideally the app itself should prevent audio from being part of backups. Users that want to back their device up to iCloud but are mindful of iCloud storage consumption should not have to manually exclude the app from their device’s backup. Preventing audio from being backed up will also greatly reduce redundant network traffic as significantly less data will be uploaded by the system by default. (It is also worth noting that iCloud Backup is enabled by default on devices signed into iCloud.) Also, doing this will reduce the time it takes for a new device to finish restoring from iCloud on slower internet connections.\r\n\r\nFoundation provides a way to mark certain files or directories created by our application as excludable from iCloud Backup, so that all data, except for that which is marked as excluded, will be included in device backups ([see article “Optimizing Your App’s Data for iCloud Backup” at developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/optimizing_your_app_s_data_for_icloud_backup)). Quran recitation/translation audio most closely fits the article’s description of “non-purgeable” data. To prevent backing up non-purgeable data, it advises applying the `isExcludedFromBackup` resource value to the URL of a given file or directory. Assuming this is applicable to this application and the way it stores audio files, this may be a solution to the problem.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of iCloud Backup details of an iPhone, highlighting the large size of the app’s backup data](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a50dff2-e7e8-4531-900a-025fdf2d0860)\r\n","html_url":"https://github.com/quran/quran-ios/issues/675","labels":[{"id":356344266,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNTYzNDQyNjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quran/quran-ios/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"ee0701","default":true,"description":null},{"id":583422678,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MjI2Nzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quran/quran-ios/labels/P1","name":"P1","color":"b60205","default":false,"description":null}]},{"number":668,"title":"Add a memorizing part","body":"Could you add a memorization part inside the Quran app?","html_url":"https://github.com/quran/quran-ios/issues/668","labels":[{"id":360843384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNjA4NDMzODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quran/quran-ios/labels/feature","name":"feature","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null},{"id":583422949,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODM0MjI5NDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quran/quran-ios/labels/P3","name":"P3","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null}]},{"number":384,"title":"Persist Word Pointer state across app launches","body":"Every time I launch the app, the word pointer is off by default.
